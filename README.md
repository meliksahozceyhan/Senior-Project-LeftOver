# Senior-Project-LeftOver

Left-Over! is a mobile application that provides a sharing platform to make use of any kind of idle goods without a price. There are three categories which are reusable, consumable, and collectable. For the classification of these categories, the reusable category involves wearable items and books that are not needed by the owner. The consumable category consists of foods and beverages that are near the expiration date to be shared by supermarkets and bakeries. The last category called collectable gathers recycling companies and people who separate their garbage according to the material at home.
